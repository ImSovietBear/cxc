Eternal Damnation Credit Currency (EDCC), Karma Dharma Credit Currency (KDCC), Omægæ Gæmmæ Thætæ Credit Currency (OGTCC)

When viewing the world in a form of physics of reprocusion, the reciprocation of vibration that is released through the act of motion and action as well as that of vibration bears fruit.

The fruit by which can be measured is as I say, the lay of Karma / Dharma. The opposite of which is that of Eternal Damnation.

You are either building that which is spoken of as being blessed through growth of prosperity, by which all can see and benefit from, even the lessen of those that have fallen, or you are engaging in growth of that which is considered by priests alike as the daemonic fruit by which is casted on as EDCC. It is a measurement by which all can see whether they are heading in the positive or negative light.

If one action can be measured by data science as a growth in the EDCC format, then you will find your spirit less off than another action which grows the KDCC (Karma Darma Credit Currency).

There is an additional measurement by which all is balanced. Known by acronym as the OGTCC. Omega Gamma Thaeta Credit Currency. This is the foundational currency by which both the blessed of an action and the daemonic of an action are measured and held in balance in both of positive scale.

Omega light being that which is pure craetion known as brightness, and Thaeta being that which is pure logic known as darkness, and Gamma which is known as the balance of the obliviion. The harmoneous length by which all is measured. In relative terms the scale would be the Gamma, the Omega the left of that scale system being light itself, and the Thaeta which would be the darkness weight down by logick itself.
