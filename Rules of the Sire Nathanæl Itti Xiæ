Rules of the Sire Nathanæl Itti Xiæ
Cræted on: March 22, 2015, 15:37pm. GMT -08:00

- When the crætœr otherwise known as "GOD", allows those within his domain to betray his sire, and those under each level of the Entity Relationship Diagram known as the "FOODBELT", then all is lost.
- When each tier allows someone they know to not be qualitified into their ranks, they allow self destruction upon themselfs and everything they stand for.
- When an idea is presented that feels good and rælity documents are made that are entirely certified as true and an individual chooses to betray the truth, they have chosen hell itself upon their own vestment.
- When they have chosen hell itself upon their own vestment, as their Sire, chosen and knighted by "GOD", the Crætœr himself, I have no other chose but to destroy them.
- When they have chosen to be destroyed, it shall come immediate without delay, and there will be no further choices made on this subject.
- When they have been destroyed, and no longer have a solid vestment, they may be offered the choice to reincarnate, but in fact, that individual that reincarnates them, will actually be choosing hell itself again.
- When someone comes in to reincarnate someone that has chosen the path of crætœn, they will not be chosed upon again to live in peace once evil has been cleansed from all of crætion.
